--Event Sponsoring Through D-App:--

 >Use-Case:
 This is just a Dapp to get sponsors for ABC Event Company. After every event, Sponsors will be given equal erc20 tokens that can be redeemed to get special services and discounts from ABC event company. 

>Sponsor2 Contract: 
 It can be deployed with the address of "Sponsors" contract which is the main contract for ABC company. This contract can be deployed for just one particular event. Once event has executed and sponsors has got tokens, this contract can deleted from the system through self-destruct while sponsor's info will be saved on blockchain through its main contract "Sponsors" for future use. The amount that is needed for an event will be given at the time of deploying this contract and once it gets that amount, it won't add more sponsors for that event. Second condition is that only 100 sponsors will be added through events by ABC company. Once a sponsor has entered in the system, they would have to sponsor something in future event to get rewards or else they can walk out from the system.  

>Sponsors Contract: It can be deployed with the address of rewards contract so that tokens can be minted and cna be given to sponsors. Sponsors can withdraw their tokens from this contract.
